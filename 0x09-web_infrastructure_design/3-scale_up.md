Infrastructure Setup:

1. Server: The main purpose of the server is to host and manage the entire infrastructure. It acts as the central point for managing and coordinating the various components.

2. Load Balancer (HAproxy): The load balancer is responsible for distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability and efficient utilization of resources. It improves performance and provides fault tolerance by evenly distributing the load among the servers.

3. Web Server: The web server handles HTTP requests from clients and serves static content such as HTML, CSS, and images. It delivers web pages to users and can handle basic processing of dynamic content using server-side scripting languages like PHP or Node.js. The web server's primary focus is to serve web content efficiently.

4. Application Server: The application server is responsible for processing dynamic content and executing business logic. It hosts the application code and provides an environment to run server-side applications. The application server can handle complex tasks such as database interactions, session management, and application-specific processing. It communicates with the web server to generate dynamic content for client requests.

5. Database Server: The database server stores and manages data required by the application. It handles read and write operations and ensures data integrity and security. The application server interacts with the database server to retrieve or update data as needed.

Explanation:

Load Balancer (HAproxy):
The load balancer is added to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers. By distributing the load, it prevents any single server from becoming overwhelmed and ensures high availability. If one server fails or becomes overloaded, the load balancer redirects traffic to other healthy servers. This setup improves performance, scalability, and reliability.

Web Server:
The web server is added to efficiently handle and serve static content. It specializes in processing HTTP requests and delivering web pages to clients. By separating static content handling from dynamic content processing, the web server can focus on its primary task, resulting in faster response times and improved performance.

Application Server:
The application server is included to handle the processing of dynamic content and execute complex business logic. It provides an environment to run server-side applications, interact with databases, and perform application-specific tasks. By separating the application logic from the web server, it allows for scalability, easier maintenance, and better resource allocation.

Database Server:
The database server is essential for storing and managing application data. It ensures data integrity, handles concurrent read and write operations, and provides secure access to the data. By dedicating a separate server for the database, it improves performance and allows for efficient data management.

Splitting the components into separate servers:
Separating the components into different servers offers several advantages:

1. Scalability: Each component can be scaled independently based on its specific requirements. For example, if the web server receives more traffic, additional web servers can be added to handle the load without impacting the application server or database server.

2. Isolation: Isolating components reduces the impact of failures or resource-intensive tasks on other components. If one component experiences issues, it can be addressed without affecting the entire infrastructure.

3. Performance: Dedicated servers allow each component to utilize system resources optimally. The application server can focus on executing business logic, while the web server can efficiently serve static content.

4. Security: Isolating components enhances security by limiting access and reducing the attack surface. By securing each server individually, potential vulnerabilities are isolated to specific components.

Overall, this infrastructure setup provides flexibility, scalability, improved performance, high availability, and enhanced security by separating the responsibilities and functions of different servers.
